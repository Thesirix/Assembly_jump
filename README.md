# 🐇 Assembly_jump – Assembly x86-64

A fully playable **Doodle Jump** clone developed entirely in **x86-64 assembly** for Windows.

## 💡 Why Assembly?

I built this project out of a deep commitment to **truly understanding computer science** at its core. My goal was to strip away high-level abstractions to master machine architecture and learn how to write **radically optimized** software. This is not just a game; it's a deep dive into the bare metal.
